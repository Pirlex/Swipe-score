        "explanation": "A $100B US investment commitment is significantly positive for AAPL's public image and domestic operations, though partially reactive to tariff threats. The announcement is confirmed (not speculative) and represents a major capital commitment that could influence both government relations and investor confidence. The scale of investment and political implications make this highly impactful for the stock."

However, the impact on Apple is likely minimal as the company has significant resources and its own AI initiatives. The deal appears to be in discussion phase rather than confirmed."

While Bloomberg is generally reliable for Apple news, this is still a future product rumor.

        "explanation": "While WWDC was described as 'underwhelming', analysts are still maintaining buy recommendations, suggesting overall positive sentiment despite initial disappointment. The event has already occurred, hence maximum likelihood score. The impact is moderate-to-low as WWDC announcements typically have limited immediate effect on stock price, especially when described as underwhelming."

The moderate impact score reflects that while tariff avoidance is important, it's likely already partially priced into the stock."
